* 7 Days Of Code Challenge
  * The challenge proposes to follow simple guidelines given over the course of 7 days to solve everyday problems. 
 
* The main focus of this project was to practice:
  * Basic programming logic using javascript;

- Schedule
  - Day 1: Conditionals
  - Day 2: Input values
  - Day 3: Loops
  - Day 4: Guessing Game
  - Day 5: Lists
  - Day 6: Lists manipulation
  - Day 7: Basic Calculator

- Observations:
  - Since the exercise was to train basic javascript logic, for each program I tried to use only the logic required for the exercise
  - I decided to create a basic html page to display and test the code. It was not required for this exercise.
